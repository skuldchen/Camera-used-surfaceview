# Camera-used-surfaceview
Hello.
This is Skuld Chen, He is a new guy for Android developer since on 20150302. 
His First project is camera but customer. Therefore, any about Mediastore, camera2, and so on does not used.
Also due to used surface, when this program would saving photo, it should be used different ways.
And when saving, many sample program only provide small way, whcih is 200*200 or less.
He soluted those service. 
He would not provide very well because his mother language is T-Chinese, so he provide some sample code
want reader can reading by themself. 
This sample code used SurfaceView, therefore Activity life does not match in this program.
This sample code also required callback function.
Reader could require basic element before they start this program.
